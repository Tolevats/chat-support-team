## Evaluation Rubric Indicators

1. Generate a project following the principles of **mobile first design and responsive design**.
    - For mobile devices the list of recent conversations should be displayed downwards or upwards only by pressing the corresponding button or link, that is, this list should be collapsible.
    - On desktop devices, the list of recent conversations should always be displayed on the left and the current conversation on the right.
    - The time or date (if the message was not sent/received today) of the last message should be displayed in each item (conversation) in the conversation list.
    - Show at least the 5 most recent conversations in the conversation list.
    - If there are unread messages, the name of the sender should be displayed in bold, losing this feature once the conversation is clicked on.
2. It includes an attractive, simple and adaptable **navigation bar**.
    - A _navigation bar_ on desktop devices, and a **button** on mobile devices, that allow moving to other sections of the website or to the previous page, depending on the size of the device.
3. Includes a **dropdown menu** for attaching items.
    - There should be a _dropdown menu_ to attach elements of different types (images, videos, and documents).
4. Properly align **dialog clouds**, add a suitable **background**, and display the name and image of the user you're interacting with.
    - The sender and receiver's dialogue clouds should be different colors and aligned oppositely.
    - The background should not be white; Ideally, use an image that is not distracting (with dull colors and without many elements).
5. The profile image expands when you hover over it and adds a **conversation search** engine.
    - The profile photo of the user you are talking to and their name should appear at the top of the current conversation.
    - Add a _conversation search_ engine (not functional).
